This is a todo list of things that I would like to add.
Shout out to KonoM for some of these suggestions!

- Tree view of servers, channels, messages.
- Better code view, code highlighting.
- Auto-reconnect.
- Auto-changing from backup nick -> original nick on reconnect.
- Append _'s or user choice of suffix to nickname upon reconnect if nick is taken.
- Auto-ghost attempt at reconnect.
- Add support for right-to-left text.

Done - Add option for viewing image links within the client (please do not make this crash the client!).
Done - Notifications (balloon + optionally sound)
Done - Monospace fonts, also 1 up the size.
Done - Automatically resizing user list.
Done - Network overload icon.
